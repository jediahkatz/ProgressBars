# ProgressBars for Processing

### Installation
Download the file `ProgressBars.zip` from the `distribution` folder. Go to your Processing libraries folder (by default it's at `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Processing\libraries`) and extract `ProgressBars.zip` to a folder called `ProgressBars`. Finally, you should be able to access the library from your Processing IDE by clicking `Sketch > Import Library > ProgressBars`.
